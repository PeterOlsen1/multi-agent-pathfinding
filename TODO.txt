* Fix delayed improvement agent
    - infinite recursion?


Augment A* agent to return a shortest path
    * pop from searched whenever we pop extra from frontier?


* implement simmulated annealing
* implement delayed improvement search
* implement bidirectional search

* use manhattan distance as opposed to square root to go faster?
