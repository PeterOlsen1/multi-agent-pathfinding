* Start improvement process
    * Make A* that doesn't remember moves but has penalties? (still has frontier)
    * Make the above thing but with memory lookup?
    * put A* with set in the optimized agents and leave it as list in general agents, or use matrix?

* Heuristic adjustment agent

* Produce shaded regions in graphs that have means
    * use the fill_between function
    * visualize with seaborn for better looks?
